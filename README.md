# Blender Stack Spin ðŸŒ€

**Compatible Version:** Blender 4.4.3
**Inspiration:** Study based on the tutorial "[Create a Stack of Cubes Animation in Blender with Python](https://youtu.be/mJU7owctel4?si=tBonEUbn1YwN3MQF)" by CG Python.

## Description ðŸ“Œ
This project is a Python implementation for Blender that creates an animated spinning stack of cylinders. Developed as part of a study on 3D animation automation using Blender's API, with adjustments for version 4.4.3.

### Features:
- ðŸ“¦ Procedural generation of a cylinder stack
- ðŸŽ¨ Random color application for each cylinder
- ðŸ”„ Smooth rotation animation on custom axes

## âœ¨ Animation Showcase âœ¨
See the magic in action! Below are examples of different geometric animations created with the script:
